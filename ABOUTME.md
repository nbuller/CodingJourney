# Who am I?
Hi, I'm Nathan Buller and this is a story about me!
    I currently hold an associate's degree in Industrial instrumentation which I used to land my current job at the Goodyear tire and rubber manufacturing plant. This job consists of troubleshooting industrial equipment using multimeters, wiring diagrams, and PLCs.

# Found my passion!
I enjoy programming on the SLC 500 and AllenBradly 5000 PLCs so much that I am now teaching myself HTML, JavaScript, and CSS in my free time, and looking to find a job programming full time. My goal is to work as a programmer with a company where I can grow as a programmer with a team that is like family. I hope to become the guy in that team that people call on when they're stuck and are having programming issues. I can self-learn, I'm highly motivated, and always bring positive energy to the team.
