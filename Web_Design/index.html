    <div id="container">
      <div class="lesson">
        <h1>Lesson 1: Basics of HTML</h1>
        <p>This is the frist step in my journey to becomeing a programmer.</p>
        <p>
          New paragraphs will have a line space between them like you see above.
        </p>
        This is a line break.<br />
        it works well for addresses.<br />
        or anything you dont wont a line space between.<br />
      </div>
      <!-- This is where i practiced div, span, Id's -->
      <div class="lesson">
        <h2>Lesson 2: Div, Span, Id's</h2>
        <p>
          You can use a div to contain a section of information to structure out
          your website to make it easier to style later.
        </p>
        <p>A div will move the contents down one line of code.</p>
        <p>
          You can use a span to contain a section of information to structure
          out your website to make it easier to style later.
        </p>
        <p>A Span will keep the contents on the same line of code.</p>
        <p>
          Ex. If you insert a div between
          <b>Lesson 2: and Div, Span, Id's</b> then the Div, Span, Id's would
          appear on the line below Lesson 2.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you used span instead it would be as it is in bold at the top of
          the page.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can add an ID to your div like div id=course info to make the code
          easier to read and sytle later on.
        </p>
      </div>
      <!-- this is where i practiced hyperlinks -->
      <div class="lesson">
        <h2>Lesson 3: Hyper Links</h2>
        <button type="button" onclick="alert('The button has been pushed')">
          Push the button
        </button>
        <p>So you want to link one index page to another index page.</p>
        <p>
          You can put a list between two nav code lines for organizaion and easy
          or read.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then for each link use (a href) plus the http address to hyperlink.
        </p>
        <p>Best practice is to have hyperlinks open in a new tab.</p>
        <p>
          You can use target="blank" after your (a href=web address) to have the
          links open in a new tab.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can use an index.html in place of the http address (where index is
          the folder name) if the location is within the same folder.
        </p>
        <p>
          you can link out with an anchor to a name tag. see below examples.
        </p>
        <!-- praticed ordered list -->
        <ol>
          <li>Learn HTML</li>
          <li>learn CSS</li>
          <li>Learn JavaScript</li>
          <li>Learn Python</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Another option is unordered list.</p>
        <!--  praticed unordered list  -->
        <ul>
          <li>Learn HTML</li>
          <li>learn CSS</li>
          <li>Learn JavaScript</li>
